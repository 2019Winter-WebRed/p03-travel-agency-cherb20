            <blockquote>"...but nothing on Tahiti is so majestic as what faces it across the bay, for there lies the island of Moorea. To describe it is impossible. It is a monument to the prodigal beauty of nature."

            <!-- This is a quote for the reviews -->
            <blockquote>"All the time our visits to the islands have been more like dreams than realities: the people, the life,    the beachcombers, the old stories and the songs I have picked up..."
            - Robert Louis Stevenson</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"We had an amazing honeymoon thanks to PaduaPandaTravel.com. I did a lot of research in attempting to book the trip myself but the packages offered by PaduaPandaTravel.com were by far the best option. It was not only the ease of having our meals and activities booked ahead of time, but the smaller details added so much more to make our honeymoon special! Everything went so smoothly and was organized, making the trip so easy for us. We are so thankful for such a memorable experience." -Mark Smith</blockquote>
